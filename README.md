<h1>Project Overview</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Library Management System! This project aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly platform for borrowing and returning books. Whether you're a librarian or an avid reader, this system is designed to make book management efficient and accessible.</p>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.</p>

<p>cd kiosk</p>

<h1>Running the Project</h1>
<h2>Fake Backend with Json Server</h2>
<p>To simulate a backend environment for development purposes, I use Json Server. To start the fake backend, run:</p>
<p>npm run mocks</p>
<p>This will launch the Json Server with mock data, allowing you to interact with the application as if it were connected to a real backend.</p>


<h2>Development Server</h2>
<p>To start the development server, run:</p>
<p>npm run dev</p>
<p>This command uses React scripts to run the application in development mode, enabling hot-reloading and other development-friendly features.</p>
