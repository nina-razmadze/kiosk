<h1>Running the Project</h1>
<h2>Fake Backend with Json Server</h2>
<p>To simulate a backend environment for development purposes, I use Json Server. To start the fake backend, run:</p>
<p>npm run mocks</p>
<p>This will launch the Json Server with mock data, allowing you to interact with the application as if it were connected to a real backend.</p>
